        ": Python language is freely available at the official website and you can download it from the given download link below click on the Download Python keyword. Download Python Since it is open-source, this means that source code is also available to the public. So you can download it, use it as well as share it.\n",

        "**2. Easy to code**\n",
        ": Python is a high-level programming language. Python is very easy to learn the language as compared to other languages like C, C#, Javascript, Java, etc. It is very easy to code in the Python language and anybody can learn Python basics in a few hours or days. It is also a developer-friendly language.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Easy to Read**\n",
        "As you will see, learning Python is quite simple. As was already established, Python’s syntax is really straightforward. The code block is defined by the indentations rather than by semicolons or brackets.\n",
        "\n",

        "**8. Python is a Portable language**\n",
        ": Python language is also a portable language. For example, if we have Python code for Windows and if we want to run this code on other platforms such as Linux, Unix, and Mac then we do not need to change it, we can run this code on any platform.\n",

Backend is the strong forte of Python it’s extensively used for this work cause of its frameworks like Django and Flask.\n",
